## Learn German in an engineered way !

# &#128161; Idea behind this Project
This project aims to build a database for the vocabulary we learn over time. We add new words and corresponding sentences into two files: L#_Word.txt and L#_Sentences.txt. By converting these sentences into audio files, we can review new vocabularies more easily just by listening.

I split the L#_Sentences.txt file into clusters, where each cluster contains e.g. 20 sentences. Then I use the [TTS library](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS), an open-source tool for advanced Text-to-Speech generation, to generate audio files for each cluster. In [Review](https://github.com/NimaMajidi1997/Deutsch_lernen/tree/main/L20) folder, you can find each audio file containing the 20 sentences along with its corresponding pdf file. In pdf file , you will find both German sentence and English meaning.

# &#128161; Stage 1:
First, install the TTS library using:

```bash
pip install TTS
```
And then TeX Live package:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install texlive-latex-base
sudo apt install texlive-full
```

Then, you can run the [Generator.py](https://github.com/NimaMajidi1997/Deutsch_lernen/blob/main/Generator.py). This script, first, asks you about the lesson number, for example you are working in lesson 19 (L_19), you enter '19'. Then it asks you if you need the audio generation. You answer yes or no. Finally, it will cluster your sentences and generate the corresponding audio and pdf files.

ðŸ“ŒImportant noteðŸ“Œ

In L#_Sentences.txt, when you are adding the new sentences, it is necesssary to follow this style:

```bash
German-sentence-test-1. #(English-meaning-test-1.)
German-sentence-test-2. #(English-meaning-test-2.)
German-sentence-test-3. #(English-meaning-test-3.)
.
.
.
```

## &#129409; And?
Now you can easily listen to these audio files to review and recap new words while you're sleeping, exercising, or doing other activities.

You can also print out flashcards!

PS: sentences are mostly generated by myself or Chat-GPT. These sentences help me to remember the meaning of the words in the context.


# &#128161; Stage 2:

Listening to German-language content like Welt playlists on YouTube is an excellent way to improve your skills! Here's a structured approach to make the most of it, suggested by Chat-GPT:

### 1. Choose Appropriate Content: 
Start with topics you enjoy or are familiar with to keep it engaging.
Focus on videos with clear pronunciation and slower speech if possible.

### 2. Use Subtitles Strategically
**`First Watch:`** (with subtitles in German): Read along and try to understand the meaning. Write down unfamiliar words and phrases to look up later.

**`Second Watch:`** (without subtitles): Focus on listening comprehension. Try to catch the main ideas and details without reading.

### 3. Active Engagement
**`Shadowing:`** Pause after sentences and repeat aloud to practice pronunciation and intonation.

**`Transcription:`** Write down what you hear and compare it to subtitles or transcripts to check for accuracy.

**`Summarization:`** After watching, summarize the video in your own words, either orally or in writing.

### 4. Daily Practice
Dedicate at least 15â€“30 minutes daily to listening practice.

### 5. Review Vocabulary
Use a notebook to review new words regularly. Include phrases and context, not just isolated words.
